The workshop will take place in different venues across the island of Tenerife. The main facilities are located in Chayofa (address: Barranco del Verodal, 38652 Chayofa, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, [link](https://www.villaginevra.com/)). Attendees should proceed there for check-in and further instructions.

Weather in Tenerife during the first two weeks of October is fairly mild, with minimum temperatures around 18-20ºC and maximum temperatures around 24-26ºC. The precipitation chances are less than 10% and the sea water temperature is still pleasant. However, we advise you to check the weather report periodically and plan your clothing accordingly.
