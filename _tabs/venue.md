The workshop will take place in different venues across the province of Malaga. The main facilities are located in Marbella (address: Avenida 3, n. 74, 29604 Marbella). Attendees should proceed there for check-in and further instructions. 

Weather in Malaga during the first two weeks of October is fairly mild, with minimum temperatures around 18-20ºC and maximum temperatures around 24-26ºC. The precipitation chances are less than 10% and the sea water temperature is still pleasant. However, we advise you to check the weather report periodically and plan your clothing accordingly.
