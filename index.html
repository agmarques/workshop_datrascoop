<h1>Workshop DATRASCOOP</h1>

<p>Welcome to the webpage of the 1st Workshop on Data and Transportation Science Cooperation (DATRASCOOP), that will be held in Marbella between the 4th and the 9th of October of 2023.</p>

<p>The workshop's objective is to bring together experts from transportation, signal processing, machine learning, and optimization, with the aim of fostering knowledge exchange and identifying innovative collaborative approaches to tackle the most critical challenges encountered by transportation systems.</p>

<p>Topics of interest include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mixed Integer Programming techniques for transportation systems.</li>
    <li>Nonlinear optimization for transportation systems.</li>
    <li>Machine learning for transportation systems.</li>
    <li>Stochastic monitoring, control and optimization of transportation systems.</li>
    <li>Robust monitoring, control and optimization of transportation systems.</li>
    <li>Bilevel optimization in transportation systems.</li>
    <li>Reinforcement learning for transportation systems.</li>
    <li>Prediction of spatio-temporal signals in transportation systems.</li>
    <li>Sparse optimization for transportation systems.</li>
    <li>Application of deep learning to the monitoring, control and optimization of transportation systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>This workshop is partially supported by the Grant TED2021-130347B-I00, funded by MCIN/AEI/ 10.13039/501100011033 and the European Union Next Generation EU/PRTR.</p>
